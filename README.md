# Tauri + Nuxt Project Template

A streamlined GitHub template for initializing a modern project with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) (v2.0.6) and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) (v3.14.159). Quickly spin up a secure and high-performance desktop application with the versatility of Nuxt for frontend development.

> **Note**: Tauri 2.0.6 does not work out-of-the-box with Nuxt, and running Tauri directly through npm scripts may cause issues. This template addresses these compatibility challenges and will be continuously updated for improvements.

## Features

- **Tauri**: Secure, lightweight, and optimized for native desktop applications.
- **Nuxt 3**: Flexible and powerful full-stack framework, enhancing frontend capabilities with Vue 3.
- **Cross-platform Support**: Build for Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single codebase.
- **Easy Setup**: Streamlined template for rapid initialization of Tauri and Nuxt projects.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Recommended version [v20.19 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- **Rust**: Latest stable version. Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Tauri CLI**: Install globally via `cargo install tauri-cli`.
